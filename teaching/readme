What?

No-nonsense, function driven game engine to create modular AI and game logic dynamically.

Why?

I got upset at writing such similar code to handle basic game functions, like looping through every object's tick function, handling collision, spawning enemies, etc.

How?

Define the properties associated with those behaviors in src/properties.
Define the functions associated with those behaviors, by key, in src/functions.
Generate things with generateThing(['BasicObject','StupidHunter']), passing in the names of behaviors you want.
Create a game controller with gameController();
Generate things with generateThing(['BasicObject','StupidHunter']), passing in the names of behaviors you want.
Assign team identities to the new thing for your controllers to reference. For example:
`
var player = generateThing(['BasicObject','Player]);
player.teams = ['Player','Gravity-Enabled']
`

do .register(yourNewThing) on your gameController.

Now anything can call .findTarget(someTeamName) to get an object that was registered with that team name.
