slingshot {

function 1(){
	vector in straight line towards player
	when vector will not take fury closer to player, calculate {
		get angle for 10 px from fury.l to player.l
		apply angle to current velocity	
	}
	expected result {
		straight line, doesn't chase player
		player crosses threshhold to adjust fury
	}
}

function 2(){
	reverse gravity {
		radius in newtonian calculation calculated from N - R where N is ###
	}
}

function 3(){
	circling and firing {
		fury orbits player
		tap to shoot at its current angular velocity
	}
}

function 4() {
	when distance is too far calculate {
		apply force from fury to player
	}
	tighten distance by clicking
	fade velocity down to zero over time
}

trailing fury chases player
fury hits enemy - converts enemy to dead, sends enemy to end
strong shell - hits enemy, loses 1 strength of shell, enemy changes vector, shell remains same
